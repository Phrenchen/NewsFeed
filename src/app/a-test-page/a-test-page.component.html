<p>Build your own civilization starting from scratch with just a treck of settlers. compete, trade and fight wars with other civilizations and research technology to gain an advantage.</p>

<h4>ii. Worms</h4>
<p>Armed with all kinds of (ridiculous) weapons, lead your small troop of worms into battle. Shaping landscapes as you use dynamite, rockets or plain baseball bats. Fail hilariously :)</p>
